# DEFINED VARIABLES:
Maximum label (define pulse, define delay) length is 15 characters.
Maximum number of operands in "x = y1 + y2 + ..." is 8.
Maximum number of defined pulses is 166.
Maximum number of defined delays is 128; MC has 2 more and 1 per incremented variable.
Maximum number of defined loopcounters is 138; MC has 3 per incremented variable.

# MACRO EXPANSION IN RELATIONS:
Preprocessor macro definitions do not work in quoted strings, but do work in comments.
To allow expansion push first quotation mark up (DOES NOT WORK IN REAL TIME!):
"
p1 = 2u"
For conditionals closed parentheses {} are invalid outside single line "" due to a buggy syntax check. Workaround is possible by putting them on separate lines.
"
if (p1 > 1u) {p2 = 3u;
} else {p2 = 4u;
}"
